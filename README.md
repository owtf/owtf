**OWASP OWTF** is a project focused on penetration testing efficiency
and alignment of security tests to security standards like the OWASP
Testing Guide (v3 and v4), the OWASP Top 10, PTES and NIST so that
pentesters will have more time to

- See the big picture and think out of the box
- More efficiently find, verify and combine vulnerabilities
- Have time to investigate complex vulnerabilities like business
  logic/architectural flaws or virtual hosting sessions
- Perform more tactical/targeted fuzzing on seemingly risky areas
- Demonstrate true impact despite the short timeframes we are
  typically given to test.

The tool is highly configurable and anybody can trivially create simple
plugins or add new tests in the configuration files without having any
development experience.

> **Note**: This tool is however not a **silverbullet** and will only be
> as good as the person using it: Understanding and experience will be
> required to correctly interpret tool output and decide what to
> investigate further in order to demonstrate impact.

# Requirements

OWTF is developed on KaliLinux and macOS but it is made for Kali Linux
(or other Debian derivatives)

OWTF supports Python3.


## OSX pre-requisites

Dependencies: Install Homebrew (<https://brew.sh/>) and follow the steps
given below:

```{.sourceCode .bash}
python3 -m venv ~/.virtualenvs/owtf
source ~/.virtualenvs/owtf/bin/activate
brew install coreutils gnu-sed openssl
# We need to install 'cryptography' first to avoid issues
pip install cryptography --global-option=build_ext --global-option="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib" --global-option="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include"
```

# Installation

## Running as a Docker container:
The recommended way to use OWTF is by building the Docker Image so you will not have to worry about dependencies issues and installing the various pentesting tools.

* `docker` and `docker-compose` is required. (https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

```
git clone https://github.com/owtf/owtf
cd owtf
make compose
```


## Installing directly

### Create and start the PostgreSQL database server

#### Using preconfigured Postgresql Docker container (Recommended)

> Please make sure you have Docker installed!

Run `make startdb` to create and start the PostgreSQL server in a Docker container. In the default configuration, it listens on port 5342 exposed from Docker container.

#### Manual setup (painful and error-prone)

> You can also use a script to this for you - find it in `scripts/db_setup.sh`. You'll need to modify any hardcoded variables if you change the corresponding ones in `owtf/settings.py`.

Start the postgreSQL server,

* macOS: `brew install postgresql` and `pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start`
* Kali: `sudo systemctl enable postgresql; sudo systemctl start postgresql or sudo service postgresql start`

Create the `owtf_db_user` user,

* macOS: `psql postgres -c "CREATE USER $db_user WITH PASSWORD '$db_pass';"`
* Kali: `sudo su postgres -c "psql -c \"CREATE USER $db_user WITH PASSWORD '$db_pass'\""`

Create the database,

* macOS: `psql postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE $db_name WITH OWNER $db_user ENCODING 'utf-8' TEMPLATE template0;"`
* Kali: `sudo su postgres -c "psql -c \"CREATE DATABASE $db_name WITH OWNER $db_user ENCODING 'utf-8' TEMPLATE template0;\""`


### Installing OWTF

```
git clone https://github.com/owtf/owtf
cd owtf
python3 setup.py develop
owtf
open `localhost:8009` in the web browser for the OWTF web interface or `owtf --help` for all available commands.
```

# Features

- **Resilience**: If one tool crashes **OWTF**, will move on to the
  next tool/test, saving the partial output of the tool until it
  crashed.
- **Flexible**: Pause and resume your work.
- **Tests Separation**: **OWTF** separates its traffic to the target
  into mainly 3 types of plugins:
  - **Passive** : No traffic goes to the target
  - **Semi Passive** : Normal traffic to target
  - **Active**: Direct vulnerability probing
- Extensive REST API.
- Has almost complete OWASP Testing Guide(v3, v4), Top 10, NIST, CWE
  coverage.
- **Web interface**: Easily manage large penetration engagements
  easily.
- **Interactive report**:
- **Automated** plugin rankings from the tool output, fully
  configurable by the user.
- **Configurable** risk rankings
- **In-line notes editor** for each plugin.
