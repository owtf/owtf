- Install script: /root/owtf/install.sh 
	Running this might be beneficial since some plugins need the dependencies installed there.

        The script is very simple and it will ask before doing things as follows:
        root@bt:~/owtf# ./install.sh
        Upgrade Backtrack/Ubuntu? [y/n]

        Patch SET? [y/n]
        NOTE: This is only necessary if you would like to run PHISHING plugins

        Install Selenium? [y/n]
        NOTE: This is only necessary if you would like to run SELENIUM plugins

-  I think it is cleaner to run owtf from a separate directory, that way the generated output files will be on that directory:

        root@bt:~# cd test_here/
        root@bt:~/test_here# /root/owtf/owtf.py -l aux <- list auxiliary plugins (all tests have been implemented as auxiliary plugins)

- Plugins can be run one by one or in bulk, I think the quickest is to run plugins like this:

        /root/owtf/owtf.py -o Spear_Phising <- run only the Spear Phising attack
        /root/owtf/owtf.py -o Spear_Phising,Exploit_Launcher <- run only these two tests, so with "," you can specify all the tests you wish to run in one go.

- IMPORTANT: Overriding defaults + Force overwrite option. Sometimes you may get a message like this:

        [*] Plugin: Spear Phising (se) has already been run, skipping ..

        To avoid that, use the "-f" option to "force overwrite", this will overwrite previous results in the output files but do what you probably want: Run the test again.
        You can also delete the output directory to achieve the same result: rm -rf owtf_review

        /root/owtf/owtf.py -f -o Spear_Phising PHISHING_PAYLOAD=5 <- In this case I am overwriting results "-f" + I am also overriding defaults: The commandline wins over the config file, you can override settings on the fly as you wish. In this example, even though Payloads are defaulted as 1,2,3,4,...18 I am explicitly making sure that only Payload 5 is used.

- How do I know what parameters does an auxiliary plugin accept?

        Similar to metasploit, just add the uppercase letter "O" as one of the arguments:
        # /root/owtf/owtf.py -f -o Spear_Phising PHISHING_PAYLOAD=5 O
        ....

- Configuration: Yes above is just too easy to run, the magic happens in the configuration file, look at the bottom here:  /root/owtf/profiles/general/default.cfg
        You will definitely want to change at least the target: Look at the RHOST and RPORT targets below. 

        IMPORTANT: By default, "," is a multiplier (which can be changed in the config file: REPEAT_DELIM) this means the following:

        Denial of Service
        -----------------------
        OWTF-ADoS-001_CATEGORY: HTTP_WIN,HTTP,SSL,TCP  <- Denial of Service Exploits will be searched for under all ( x 4 times) of these categories
        OWTF-ADoS-001_RHOST: 127.0.0.1 <- The Denial of Service Target, you can also use "," as with any parameter and put several targets: "127.0.0.1,127.0.0.2"
        OWTF-ADoS-001_RPORT: 80 <- The Denial of Service Port, you can add more "," like "80,443,8080" that will multiply firing all DoS exploits against each of those ports

        How to run with the default setting above (you can override configuration settings by supplying space separated arguments such as CATEGORY=TCP or RHOST=target.com, etc):
        /root/owtf/owtf.py -f -o Direct_DoS_Launcher

        OS Exploits
        ---------------
        Very similar to above. "," is a multiplier. Some combinations will not exist but owtf does not care and keeps trying until the next combination that works. I verified that many exploits fire without a payload, there will be a smarter version of this for the next release (I think auto-learn how to fire each exploit is the way to go since metasploit will keep adding more exploits and payloads)
        OWTF-AExP-001_CATEGORY: LINUX,OSX,WINDOWS
        OWTF-AExP-001_SUBCATEGORY: DCERPC,FTP,HTTP,IIS,IMAP,ISAPI,LDAP,LPD,MDNS,MISC,MMSP,MSSQL,MYSQL,NFS,NNTP,NOVELL,NTP,ORACLE,PHP,POP3,POSTGRES,PPTP,PROXY,REALSERVER,RPC,RTSP,SAMBA,SCADA,SIP,SMB,SMTP,SSH,SSL,SUNRPC,SVN,TACACS,TELNET,TFTP,VNC,VPN,WINS,WYSE
        OWTF-AExP-001_RHOST: 127.0.0.1
        OWTF-AExP-001_RPORT: 80

        How to run (you can override everything via the command line as described above):
        /root/owtf/owtf.py -f -o Exploit_Launcher

        Bruteforce
        ---------------
        Brute force is different, the parameters are more spread-out in the configuration file, here are the relevant settings:

        # Default brute-force categories:
        OWTF-ABrF-001_CATEGORY: FTP,FTPS,HTTP-PROXY,ICQ,IMAP,IRC,LDAP2,LDAP3,MSSQL,MYSQL,NCP,NNTP,ORACLE-LISTENER,ORACLE-SID,PCANYWHERE,PCNFS,POP3,POSTGRES,RDP,REXEC,RLOGIN,RSH,SIP,SMB,SMTP,SNMP,SOCKS5,SSH,SVN,TEAMSPEAK,TELNET,VMAUTHD,VNC,XMPP
        OWTF-ABrF-001_RHOST: 127.0.0.1
        OWTF-ABrF-001_RPORT: 80

        Further up in the file, owtf is only compatible with hydra at the moment but that will obviously change in the future:
        # ************************* Password brute-force dictionaries / defaults ******************************

        # This is possibly one of the best pages on the internet for password lists: http://www.skullsecurity.org/wiki/index.php/Passwords
        # Online password cracking lists must be smaller since they are for brute-forcing services, Offline password cracking is done locally
        ONLINE_USER_LIST: @@@FRAMEWORK_DIR@@@/dictionaries/users/basic_windows.txt
        ONLINE_USER_LIST_DESCRIP: Username list file separated by newline characters
        # ONLINE_PASSWORD_LIST: /pentest/passwords/wordlists/darkc0de.lst
        ONLINE_PASSWORD_LIST: @@@FRAMEWORK_DIR@@@/dictionaries/passwords/phpbb.txt
        ONLINE_PASSWORD_LIST_DESCRIP: Password list file separated by newline characters
        THREADS: 1
        THREADS_DESCRIP: Number of threads to use
        RESPONSE_WAIT: 40
        RESPONSE_WAIT_DESCRIP: Number of seconds to wait until the response arrives
        CONNECT_WAIT: 30
        CONNECT_WAIT_DESCRIP: Number of seconds to wait until the next connection attempt
        # Preferred bruteforcer program:
        BRUTEFORCER: hydra

        Usage (parameters above can be overriden via the command line as explained above):
        /root/owtf/owtf.py -f -o Password_Bruteforce

        Web attack vectors
        --------------------------
        The relevant items in the configuration file for this are:

        SELENIUM_URL_VECTORS_XSS: @@@FRAMEWORK_DIR@@@/dictionaries/attack_vectors/web/xss/basic.txt
        SELENIUM_URL_VECTORS_RCE: @@@FRAMEWORK_DIR@@@/dictionaries/attack_vectors/web/rce/basic.txt
        SELENIUM_URL_VECTORS_SQLI: @@@FRAMEWORK_DIR@@@/dictionaries/attack_vectors/web/sqli/basic.txt
        SELENIUM_URL_VECTORS_CHARSET: @@@FRAMEWORK_DIR@@@/dictionaries/attack_vectors/web/charset/basic.txt

        OWTF-ASEL-001_selenium_CATEGORY: XSS,RCE,SQLI,CHARSET
        OWTF-ASEL-001_selenium_BASE_URL: http://127.0.0.1/

        Usage (everything overrideable as usual):
        /root/owtf/owtf.py -f -o Selenium_URL_Launcher


        Phising
        ----------
        This has probably been the most difficult to put together. The relevant configuration items are these:

        # ************************* SE Spear Phising configuration (Auxiliary Plugin configuration) *************************************

        PHISING_SCRIPT_DIR: @@@FRAMEWORK_DIR@@@/scripts/set/phising
        PHISING_SCRIPT_DIR_DESCRIP: The directory where the SET phising wrapper scripts are located
        #PHISHING_PAYLOAD: 1
        PHISHING_PAYLOAD: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18
        PHISHING_PAYLOAD_DESCRIP: SET Payload for the phising attack (1-18)
        ATTACHMENT_NAME: report
        ATTACHMENT_NAME_DESCRIP: Filename for the attachment to be sent
        #SET_EMAIL_TEMPLATE: 1
        #All Email templates (i.e. IDS/Spam filter testing)
        SET_EMAIL_TEMPLATE: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
        SET_EMAIL_TEMPLATE_DESCRIP: SET Email template number to use (1-9)
        MSF_LISTENER_PORT: 443
        MSF_LISTENER_PORT_DESCRIP: Port where metasploit multi-handler will be listening to get the shells back
        MSF_LISTENER_SETUP: no
        MSF_LISTENER_SETUP_DESCRIP: Setup the listener (yes/no): "no" can be useful when the goal is IDS testing
        EMAIL_TARGET: /root/emails.txt
        EMAIL_TARGET_DESCRIP: Email or File containing the target email addresses for phising attacks
        EMAIL_PRIORITY: yes
        EMAIL_PRIORITY_DESCRIP: Send emails with high importance (use "yes") or no (use "no")
        PDF_TEMPLATE: /root/test.pdf
        PDF_TEMPLATE_DESCRIP: PDF Template file to use for some of the SET payloads that need it/can use it

        # ************************* SMTP Server configuration: SE Spear Phising configuration (Auxiliary Plugin configuration) *************************************

        EMAIL_FROM: you@gmail.com
        EMAIL_FROM_DESCRIP: Source email address to use for phising attacks
        SMTP_LOGIN: you@gmail.com
        SMTP_LOGIN_DESCRIP: Login to use to connect to the SMTP server
        SMTP_PASS: ********
        SMTP_PASS_DESCRIP: SMTP Password to use to connect to the SMTP server
        SMTP_HOST: your.mail.server.com
        SMTP_HOST_DESCRIP: SMTP Host name or IP address to use to send emails
        SMTP_PORT: 25
        SMTP_PORT_DESCRIP: SMTP Port to connect to to send the emails

        Usage:
        /root/owtf/owtf.py -f -o Spear_Phising <- run with defaults as per config file

        Default override example:
        /root/owtf/owtf.py -f -o Spear_Phising SET_EMAIL_TEMPLATE=1 EMAIL_PRIORITY=no <- only send SET_EMAIL_TEMPLATE 1 and use normal priority (EMAIL_PRIORITY=no)

- When running anything in owtf it may happen that you would like to stop the current exploit/bruteforce/etc and would like to move on to the next try. It is also possible that you just want to stop the test completely. You can do all this via Control+C. When you do that a message like this will show, just choose want you want to do:

[*] The Command was aborted by the user: Please check the report and plugin output files
Options: 'e'+Enter= Exit, 'p'+Enter= Move on to next plugin, Enter= Next test
