+ Created an alternative phishing3.2.2_listenerIP SET script directory to use in profiles/general/default.cfg: <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)
  - The point of this is to be able to simply change the PHISHING_SCRIPT_DIR to use when SET adds an additional "ask listener IP" manual step (happens sometimes)

+ Revhosts is replaced by dnsrecon as revhosts is discontinued in kali linux. <=> Bharadwaj Machiraju (@tunnelshade)
+ httprint is added to install script as the tool is not present in kali by default <=> Bharadwaj Machiraju (@tunnelshade)
+ Added missing gnutls-bin package to Kali Linux script <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)

 + Fixed SET payload 15 to take advantage of the custom PDF template <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)
 + Added a bit of SET's documentation to the readme directory <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)
 + Commented out the Attachment name modification in the Spear Phishing plugin (sometimes you may want to control this from outside the plugin) <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)
 + Added better exception handling to OWTF's SMTP class so that failure to perform the SMTP Login assumes open relay and moves on (also sent as a patch to SET) <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)
 + Added slightly better message to OWTF's SMTP START TLS exception handling error message <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)
 + Added warning to SET handler when sending blank values <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)

10/04/2012 - 0.13b "HackPra" pre-alpha release: Dedicated to HackPra (http://www.nds.rub.de/teaching/hackpra/), its organisers and attendants
 + Inclusion of slowloris, thanks to RSNake for allowing redistribution! <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)

 + More indentation clean up in various files <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)
 + Fixed bug on DeriveURLSettings: Thanks to Sandro Gauci for reporting!  <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)
   The home-brew parsing was resulting in an error like below with URLs like http://example.com:81 
   "Aborted by Framework: Cannot resolve Hostname: example.com:81"
   URL parsing is now done via the urlparse library
 + Fixed bug introduced above whereby urlparse was returning "None" for the port in the summary report: <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)
   Reintroduced scheme check to handle this case and ensure the port is never blank regardless of URL format
 + Fixed bug similar to the one in DeriveURLSettings on the OWTF Core: <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)
   IsInScopeURL was parsing the hostname from the URL in a home-brew fashion this worked ok most of the time
   but in some cases could lead to bugs, core.py is now using urlparse for parsing the hostname from the URL
 + Added regression test shell scripts to tests directory <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)

25/03/2012 - 0.13 "Trooper" pre-alpha release: Dedicated to Troopers (http://www.troopers.de/), its organisers and attendants
 + Inclusion of fuzzdb -allowed by licence- thanks! <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)
 + Inclusion of HashCollision-DOS-POC by Christian Mehlmauer (@_FireFart_) thanks! <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)
   Location: owtf_dir/tools/dos/web/HashCollision-DOS-POC
   More info: https://github.com/FireFart/HashCollision-DOS-POC
 + Installation script cleanup: tools/bt5_install.sh courtesy of Michael Kohl (@citizen428), thanks! <=> Michael Kohl (@citizen428)
 + Minor fixes to scripts/setrubyenv.sh also courtesy of Michael Kohl @citizen428), thanks! <=> Michael Kohl (@citizen428)
 + "set fuzzFormComboValues all" removed from scripts/run_w3af.sh because it may make w3af scans slow, thanks to Adi Mutu (am06) and Andrés Riancho (@w3af)! <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)
   More info: http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=CA%2B1Rt67bN3-2OpB%2B7SOGO7%3D92KWXBMdbaztpa885f%3Du2GzjcFg%40mail.gmail.com&forum_name=w3af-users
 + Created an initial basic targeted phishing plugin to send anything via SMTP: aux/se/Targeted_Phishing@OWTF-ASEP-002.py <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)
 + Created the concept of "OWTF Agents": Small listeners that establish communication channels that allow to perform actions remotely (i.e. in a victim machine) <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)
   - Added sbd-based shared-password OWTF Agent for persistent shell access to other machines to be used during a test (i.e. victim emulation)
   - Added ssh-based trusted-public-key OWTF Agent for an alternative to shared passwords (basic instructions to set this up with ssh)
   - Added initial auxiliary plugins to communicate with OWTF agents:
 	  SBD_CommandChainer is working, the others in rce are WIP (see plugins/aux/rce)
   - Added imapd OWTF agent: This checks email with a predefined account and loads the configured plugin to process the message.
       Example: 
       1) OWTF sends a targeted phishing attack via aux/se/Targeted_Phishing@OWTF-ASEP-002.py
       2) An OWTF imapd Agent processes any new email that arrives and emulates a user click for all links found in the message
 + Added initial SMB handler to the framework and a related plugin: aux/smb/SMB_Handler@OWTF-SMB-001.py <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)
 + Added an Interactive Shell handler useful to interact with remote and local shells run in a subprocess <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)
 + Significant SET integration improvements: new OWTF SET handler + spear_phishing modules and plugin/configurability tweaks  <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)
 + Added hopefully better comments in several places <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)
 + Started to use Eclipse and Fixed indentation on many framework files :P <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)
 + Bug fix: Commented out goohost shell one liners in profiles/general/default.cfg: When goohost is not installed cat hangs (Thanks to Sandro Gauci) <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)
 + Bug fix: Grep plugins were no longer showing links to Text, HTML, etc findings <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)
 + Added CAPTCHA breaker tool links to external plugin to assist manual exploitation: PWNtcha - captcha decoder, Captcha Breaker <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)
 + Added vulnerability search box to the CAPTCHA external plugin <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)
 + Added links to the "Session managament schema" external plugin: Gareth Hayes' HackVertor, Raul Siles' (Taddong) F5 BIG IP Cookie Decoder <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)
 + Added link to the "SSI Injection" external plugin: webappsec.org SSI Injection info <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)
 + Moved HTTP-Traceroute back into rev_proxy to avoid config changes <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)

10/02/2012 - 0.12 "Wicky" pre-alpha release: Dedicated to @marcwickenden for sending the first pull request!
 + Merged pull request with IPv6 support and proper IP validation from @marcwickenden thanks! <=> Marc Wickenden (@marcwickenden)
 + Added graceful framework abort when a hostname cannot be resolved (instead of python trace mess) <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)
 + Added Hurricane Electric passive recon link to discovery plugin (Thanks to Chris John Riley) <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)
 + Bug fix in plugin_handler.py and plugin_register.py to set a Start, RunTime and End date for external plugins that have been already run but require to be registered against a target to report display purposes. Only happened in separate iterations. <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)
 + Added a Sanitiser module to solve the "embedding untrusted HTML" issue, when POST is the only way to query a third party site. The filter is public and you are encouraged to break it :). An improved filter will be published shortly after each new public bypass. <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)
   REMARKS: 
   - Thank you very much to everybody that took the time to try to break the HTML filter!
   - Congratulations + props to the successful breakers before this release: Mario Heiderich, @notracecc, @dreyercito
   - If you did not try to break the filter, what are you waiting for? :)
   - The challenge will run indefinitely and is available here: http://blog.7-a.org/2012/01/embedding-untrusted-html-xss-challenge.html
 + Clean-up of passive robots.txt plugin to sanitise embedded HTML (via module above) + move this to an external file
 + plugin_helper.py clean-up for flexibility, readability and code reuse around transparent filtering and sandboxing of embedded third-party HTML (related to above)
 + When embedding HTML from a third party site OWTF will: <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)  
     1) Filter the HTML using the Sanitiser module above
     2) Save the filtered output to a file
     3) Create a separate file that embeds the filtered output inside a sanboxed iframe (just in case an unpublished bypass whatever ;))
     4) The OWTF report provides a link to the sanboxed file only
     5) Both the sandboxed + non-sandboxed files are saved to another directory = they cannot access HTML 5 localstorage (where your review is), at least in Firefox 8
 + Fixed minor but annoying bug whereby the filter was not showing up when the detailed report was collapsed, so detailed report totals were not being shown <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Added a more links to assist manual XSS exploitation: http://www.bindshell.net/tools/beef, http://xss-proxy.sourceforge.net/, http://www.gnucitizen.org/projects/backframe/ <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Integration with CKEditor (http://ckeditor.com/): <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
   1) Notes now have a full blown WYSIWYG editor -their permissive licensing allows redistribution, thank you!-
   2) Above means you can now take notes with fancy formatting: tables, links, bullet points, font format, size, style, etc (useful for exploit/PoC links, etc)
   3) The OWTF review works as usual but the notes are now saved with their formatting (HTML instead of plain text)
   4) OWTF will show an automated preview on top of the editor, this is always displayed, which makes it more intuitive to see if there are notes present for a plugin
   5) OWTF will also automatically save these formatted notes in the review for resilience: Even if your browser crashes or is closed by mistake you keep what you typed
   6) The OWTF notes preview also modify links so that they are displayed on a new tab (most useful option and consistent with other links in the report)
   7) OWTF will create/destroy CKEditor instances as follows: 1st lightbulb click: create, 2nd click: destroy = report is more lightweight, loads faster, etc
   8) OWTF will destroy all plugin editors when a new one is created: This ensures only resources for a single editor are used at any point in time (report = lightweight)
 + Bug fix: Changing the detailed report iframe size via onload event was messy: Now the iframe is created directly using the initial height defined on: COLLAPSED_REPORT_SIZE <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Enhancement: Added new review icons to be able to flag certain special cases. Icons can be removed on: profiles/general/default.cfg <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
   1) LadyBug: Flag functional and/or business logic bugs (it's up to you how you interpret this, as usual)
   2) Empty Star: To flag you had a brief look (already saw it) but no real analysis was done
   3) Half Star: To flag you had an initial look but need to investigate more to be able to rate the output
 + Created an initial help file that is linked to from the OWTF report via question mark icons <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Some clean-up around review icons code in the report a bit less messy now :P <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Plugin Review Icons are now highlighted like filters when the user clicks on them as well as when the report loads: More intuitive <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Multiple bug fixes around Import/Export Review from Summary report (Import was not working at all and other similar problems) <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Multiple space and colour optimisations in the report <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + An initial Summary Report filter has been implemented, this triggers the same filter on all children iframes, resizing them, etc <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Added unit tests to allow more efficient testing of the Sanitiser module (i.e. test quickly all previous bypasses against new filter) <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Made the Sanitiser module a bit smarter so that: <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
     1) It can be called from the framework: When this happens no tests are run, but all functionality is callable by the framework
     2) It can be called from the commandline: When this happens the Sanitiser expects HTML on stdin (i.e. cat input.txt | sanitiser.py)
     NOTE: I noticed it was handier to read from stdin (instead of a hard-coded file) so that I can regression test new filters faster
 + Significant report memory usage improvements (single review object shared for all reports, it was num_targets x review + 1 before) <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Significant report performance improvements: <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
     1) When the report loads for the first time, counters and colours are calculated and stored in localstorage
     2) Counters will only be updated when the user rates plugins from then on
     3) When the report loads again counters are not calculated (as previously= this was slow), instead they are read from localStorage
 + Lots of small report tweaks to improve navigability, general usability and appearance <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Added rudimentary reporting functionality via magic bar: Builds a basic report for ease of copy-paste in your reporting <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Refactored owtf.js into smaller files: owtf_general.js, owtf_review.js, owtf_filter.js and owtf_reporting.js <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Reorganised dictionaries and tools into "restricted" (i.e. licensing) directories so that they are not committed by mistake to github <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 

19/01/2012 - 0.11 "Vienna" pre-alpha release: Dedicated with special love to BSides Vienna (http://www.bsidesvienna.info/), its organisers and attendants
 + Significant report improvements <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + OWTF will now only execute external plugins once regardless of the number of targets (it was 1 x num_targets before, way slower) <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Host names are now retrieved properly from python via import socket + socket.gethostbyname -> i.e. cannot use dns/host when /etc/hosts is required in a pen test (Bug report credit: Sandro Gauci) <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Fixed licence to more accurately match 3-clause-BSD (the intended licence :)) <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)

 + Added links to interesting resources for manual exploitation, etc on the external Cross Site Flashing plugin (Thanks to Krzysztof Kotowicz, Michele Orru, Mario Heiderich) <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Tweaked cross site flashing passive plugin (google hacking searches) to also search for Silverlight's stuff: clientaccesspolicy.xml, .xap and .scr files  <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Tweaked cross site flashing semi passive plugin to also try to get the clientaccesspolicy.xml file (Silverlight's equivalent to crossdomain.xml) <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Tweaked regexps for Application Configuration Management (OWASP-CM-004) to reduce false positives <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Added regexps to Application Configuration Management (OWASP-CM-004) to search for PHP+ASP source code disclosure too <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Added resources (Nicolas Gregoire's XLT wiki) to XML Injection external plugin (to assist with manual exploitation) <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Added Nicolas Gregoire's HTTP-Traceroute.py reverse proxy check script to tools/discovery/web/rev_proxy (Thanks to Nicolas for allowing direct redistribution with OWTF!) <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
   Added a GET and TRACE reverse proxy checks using HTTP-Traceroute.py to: Infrastructure Configuration Management (OWASP-CM-003) - with WAF and Load Balancer checks -

 + Bug fix: owtf.py -l net (also owtf.py -g net) would crash because there are no net plugins yet: An error message explaining this is now shown instead (Bug report credit: am06, Michele Orru))  <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Bug fix: semi_passive/Testing_for_Cross_site_flashing@OWASP-DV-004.py does no longer show duplicates + minor plugin clean-up <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Bug fix: Fixed some issues on Transaction DB comparisons that resulted in the Cache not working right <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Modified web/passive/Spiders_Robots_and_Crawlers\@OWASP-IG-001.py to directly submit the form on tool.motoricerca.info (because it does not work via link, uses POST only) <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Added Start, End and Runtime fields to Plugin Register + Modified report to display the Start + End Date/Time for each plugin (potentially useful to correlate log events) <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Added http://statsie.com passive analysis link (on Passive Search Engine Discovery) <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Created a configuration health-check module by massive popular demand :). When OWTF starts it will now warn you when tools are missing and suggest how to fix it. <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Created initial rudimentary owtf_dir/tools/bt5_install.sh script (incomplete, but getting there) to download tools missing or unreliable in Backtrack 5 <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Updated install script (owtf_dir/install/bt5_install.sh) + /profiles/general/default.cfg to include the latest Arachni version (v0.4.0.2) and verified it works <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Experimental: Created a Command Register (owtf_review/db/command_register.txt) where information on all commands run is stored: <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
   - Start+End Date/Time, Runtime, Status (Finished/Cancelled), Actual command run, Command without plugin output info (needed internally for the framework)
   - Purpose 1: Avoid running the same command several times, very useful when you have several domain.com targets. A message like "command already run for target X" appears
   - Purpose 2: Simple date and time correlation becomes possible: Useful for debugging and IDS testing (which exploit worked? what command brought the server down?, etc)
   - Purpose 3: It is simply nice to have a log of every command that was run, and questions like "what tools did you run and how?" become easier to answer
 + Added link to Gareth Heyes' awesome http://shazzer.co.uk project to assist with manual XSS exploitation <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Added Command execution start date/time information on the screen so that the pen tester can make a better decision (wait/stop it) <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Experimental: Created a redirect detection mechanism so that it is more intuitive to realise when all URLs are being redirected (i.e. blanket redirect from port 80 to 443) <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
   - Status will be marked as "302 Found": Instead of the previous "200 OK", which did not reflect the redirect (not ideal but better than 200)
   - URL will be set as the redirected URL: This way it is more obvious if the target is http:// but the transaction log is all https://, that there is a blanket redirect
   - Known issue: The scope can be wrong if the redirect is performed to outside of the target URL, need to work more on this

 + Experimental: If the user supplies only domain names, the scope expands to https + http for each domain <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Experimental: If a passed URL cannot be reached it is removed from the report (assumed it does not exist) -> useful for huge scopes! <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)

 + Tried to use cool jquery icons but failed miserably: They are displayed but background sucks need a web designer :) <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Had the bright idea of changing the naming convention, which broke everything for 1day+ <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)

 + Bug fix: Added check on plugin handler so that grep plugins are skipped when Transaction DB is empty (Grep plugins grep the DB so no DB = fail) <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Bug fix: Vuln search box was broken due to jquery port changes <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Added check so that passive plugins are not run if the target ip is an RFC1918 address (aka "private" or "LAN" address) <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Added passive Testing for Admin Interfaces (OWASP-CM-007) <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)

 + Implemented persistence via localStorage, serious JavaScript refactoring: Now there is a single Review JSON object, code simplified a lot <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Made the choice between localStorage and sessvars configurable so that the user can choose and use some form of persistance (sessvars) even on old browsers. <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Because of above 2 lines the Storage has been abstracted into separate libraries: the abstraction (sessvars or localStorage) is loaded depending on configuration setting <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Implemented ability to add notes to the results of each plugin, this is saved in the JavaScript storage as well <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)

 + Bug fix: The unique html counter db was being corrupted under special circumstances (6+ multi-runs) <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Moved suggested commands from active fingerprint to passive: They are only suggested. Also created powerful primitive to suggest commands more efficiently <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Bug fix: Spider was using the previous DB instead of the one for scraped/potential URLs <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + Bug fix/Enhancement: Serious improvements to CMS Explorer import dictionaries script: Dictionaries are now converted into DirBuster format and CMS-specific <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_) 
 + After above, created new configuration lines for CMS-specific dictionaries: all, wordpress all, wordpress plugins, etc from the DirBuster format import (thx CMS Explorer). <=> Abraham Aranguren (@7a_)
